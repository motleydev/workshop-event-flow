# Event Flow

**Estimated time:** 4 Hours

In this hands-on workshop, weâ€™ll learn how to design, build, and ship an application complete with GraphQL API. We'll cover topics from event-driven architecture, low-code, GraphQL, and more.

## Project:

We'll create a tool that lets users register for an event, confirm their email, and then be scanned in via QR code.

### The event flow will be:

1. `Trigger`: Signup for event
2. `On signup`: Send confirmation email
3. `On confirm link`: send QR code
4. `On scan code`: mark attendee as present

### The service stack is:

1. Hasura Cloud
2. Retool
3. Fake mail provider
   a. Signup: https://ethereal.email/
